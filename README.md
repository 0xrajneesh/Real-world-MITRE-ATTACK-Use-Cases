# Real-world-MITRE-ATTACK-Use-Cases


üö® How SOC Teams Use MITRE ATT&CK in Real-World Scenarios üö®
SOC Analysts leverage MITRE ATT&CK to enhance security monitoring, automate threat detection, and streamline incident response in SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh, ELK) and EDR (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender ATP). Below are key activities they perform in real-world environments, along with practical examples.

üî∂ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Automated IOC Enrichment in SIEM
SOC teams automate the ingestion of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) (IP addresses, file hashes, domains) to enrich security alerts and improve threat detection.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Intelligence Feeds Integration ‚Äì SOC teams configure SIEM tools to automatically fetch IOCs from threat intelligence platforms and enrich alerts.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Suspicious File Hashes ‚Äì SOC teams correlate detected file hashes with known malware signatures using enrichment services.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping Alerts to ATT&CK Techniques ‚Äì Analysts classify alerts in SIEM according to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, helping prioritize responses.

üî∂ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Threat Detection & Alerting
SOC teams monitor SIEM and EDR alerts to detect suspicious behavior in real-time and escalate critical incidents before damage occurs.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Unusual PowerShell Activity ‚Äì SOC teams set up rules to detect suspicious PowerShell execution that might indicate malware or command execution.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Ransomware-Like Behavior ‚Äì Analysts monitor file system changes to detect mass encryption attempts indicative of ransomware.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Unusual Login Patterns ‚Äì SOC teams analyze login attempts from new or uncommon geolocations and escalate cases of potential account compromise.

üî∂ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Blocking Malicious Domains & IPs
SOC teams identify and block known malicious IPs and domains to prevent unauthorized access, malware infections, and data exfiltration.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Blocking Phishing Domains ‚Äì SOC teams use security gateways to block domains linked to phishing campaigns.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Preventing Command & Control (C2) Communications ‚Äì Analysts configure firewalls and proxies to prevent connections to known C2 servers.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Blacklisting Malicious IPs ‚Äì Threat feeds help identify IP addresses associated with brute-force attacks, botnets, and malware campaigns, which are then blocked.

üî∂ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Investigating Suspicious User Activity & Privilege Escalation
SOC teams track user behavior to detect unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, and insider threats.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Privilege Escalation ‚Äì SOC teams investigate sudden changes in user permissions that may indicate an attacker attempting to gain admin access.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking Anomalous Account Behavior ‚Äì Analysts monitor for accounts logging in at unusual hours or from multiple locations in a short timeframe.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Spotting Lateral Movement Attempts ‚Äì SOC teams detect unauthorized access to multiple systems in a network, indicating an attacker spreading internally.

üî∂ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ransomware Detection & Containment
SOC teams identify and contain ransomware attacks before they spread across the network to minimize impact.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Mass File Encryption ‚Äì Analysts configure SIEM alerts to trigger when multiple files are encrypted in a short time.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Preventing Unauthorized Process Execution ‚Äì SOC teams monitor suspicious child processes (e.g., script-based execution of encryption commands).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Isolating Affected Endpoints ‚Äì Automated response mechanisms disconnect compromised machines from the network to prevent further infection.

üî∂ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Automating Incident Response Playbooks
SOC teams use SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools to automate responses to detected threats.

‚úÖ Examples:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Automating IOC-Based Blocking ‚Äì SIEM-integrated playbooks automatically block malicious IPs and domains based on threat intelligence feeds.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Quarantining Compromised Endpoints ‚Äì If an endpoint is flagged as infected, SOAR workflows can isolate the device and notify the SOC team.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Automating Phishing Investigation ‚Äì SOC teams use automation to extract and analyze suspicious email attachments and URLs for malware indicators.

üìå Conclusion
SOC Analysts use MITRE ATT&CK to improve threat intelligence, real-time detection, blocking malicious activities, and automating incident response in SIEM, EDR, and SOAR platforms. These real-world applications help security teams stay ahead of adversaries by continuously improving their detection and response capabilities.
