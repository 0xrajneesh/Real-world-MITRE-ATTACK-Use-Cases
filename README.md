2Ô∏è‚É£ **Identifying Ransomware-Like Behavior** ‚Äì Analysts monitor file system changes to detect mass encryption attempts indicative of ransomware.  
- **CrowdStrike Falcon:** Prevents unauthorized encryption attempts using behavior analytics.  
- **Elastic SIEM:** Triggers alerts when a large number of files are modified rapidly.  
- **Wazuh:** Monitors file integrity changes for encryption-related anomalies.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Unusual Login Patterns** ‚Äì SOC teams analyze login attempts from new or uncommon geolocations and escalate cases of potential account compromise.  
- **Splunk:** Uses correlation searches to detect login anomalies.  
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Identifies unauthorized access attempts using conditional access policies.  
- **ELK Stack:** Maps login patterns against known user behavior.

### üî∂ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Blocking Malicious Domains & IPs  
SOC teams **identify and block known malicious IPs and domains** to prevent unauthorized access, malware infections, and data exfiltration.

#### ‚úÖ Examples & Use Cases  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Blocking Phishing Domains** ‚Äì SOC teams use security gateways to block domains linked to phishing campaigns.  
- **Microsoft Defender ATP:** Automatically blocks URLs classified as phishing threats.  
- **Cisco Umbrella:** Prevents access to malicious domains via DNS filtering.  
- **Splunk Phantom:** Automates domain blocking using external threat intelligence feeds.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Preventing Command & Control (C2) Communications** ‚Äì Analysts configure firewalls and proxies to prevent connections to known C2 servers.  
- **Palo Alto Firewall:** Uses DNS filtering to block C2-related domains.  
- **CrowdStrike Falcon:** Identifies and isolates machines communicating with C2 infrastructure.  
- **Suricata IDS:** Generates alerts when network traffic matches known C2 patterns.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Blacklisting Malicious IPs** ‚Äì Threat feeds help identify IP addresses associated with brute-force attacks, botnets, and malware campaigns, which are then blocked.  
- **Splunk:** Uses SIEM correlation to track malicious IPs in network logs.  
- **Wazuh:** Monitors active network connections and flags known bad IPs.  
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Automates IP blocking based on live threat intelligence feeds.
